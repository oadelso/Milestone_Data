# Emotion Recognition

Under the 'Model' sections there will be a series of python scripts which changed the original architecture in the cs230 sample code for pytorch, which can be found in the link below:

Our best performing model was hybrid.py. This architecture is also saved in the net.py script which is the one that is ran when running the train.py script. The outsputs for this model can be found under the experiments folder, as well as in the confusion matrix folder.
